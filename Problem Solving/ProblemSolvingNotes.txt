Algorithm- a process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task

Problem Solving
1. Understand the Problem
  a. Can I restate the problem in my own words
  b. What are the inputs
  c. What are the outputs (returned from solution)
  d. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs?
  e. How should i label important pieces of data?
2. Explore concrete examples
3. Break it down
4. Solve/simplify
5. Look back and refactor

Example: Write a function which takes two numbers and returns their sum
UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM
1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
  Write a function that adds two numbers.
2.  What are the inputs?
  Will we always receive two inputs? More? Less?
  Is there an upper bound? (js returns infinity for numbers that are too big)
  Are both inputs of the same type?
3. 
4. 
5. function Add(num1, num2);

Example: Write a function which takes in a string and returns counts of each character in the string?
UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM
1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
  Write a function that counts the number of time a given character in a string exists.
2.  What are the inputs?
  Undefined? Null? Empty string?
3. What are the outputs
  Object {
    char: count
  }
4. Can outputs be determined from the input?
5. Label important pieces of data 
  function characterCount(str)

  EXAMPLES
  Simple

  characterCount("aaaa"); // {a:4}
  characterCount("hello"); // {h:1, e:1, l:2, o:1}

  // At this point, should our object already contain all characters initialized at 0. Then we just need to update the value instead of adding a new char?

  Complex
  characterCount("my phone number is 182763?");
  // are we going to account for spaces? numbers? special characters?

  characterCount("Hello hi"); 
  // do we store both uppercase and lowercase H?
  /// {H:1, h:1} or {h:2} or {H:2}

  Empty inputs
  characterCount();
  characterCount("");

  Invalid inputs
  characterCount(null);
  characterCount(1);

  // What  should we return?


BREAK IT DOWN

Write out the steps you need to take

// most simple
function characterCount(str) {
  // do something
  // return an object with keys that are lowercase alphanumeric characters in the string; 
}

// expanded solution
function characterCount(str) {
  // make object to return at end
  // loop over string, for each character...
    // if char is a number/letter and is a key in object, add one to count
    // if char is a number/letter and is not in object, add it and set value to 1
    // if char is something else (space, ., etc) dont do anything
  // return object at end
}

SIMPLIFY/SOLVE

Don't get stuck on one small detail...write the 90% or so you know then you can plug.


LOOK BACK & REFACTOR
Can you check the result?
Can you derive result differently?
Can you undertand it at a glance?
Can you use result or method for some other problem?
Can you improve the performance?
Can you think of other ways to refactor?
How have others solved this problem?
